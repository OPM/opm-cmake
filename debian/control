Provides: libopm-common
Description: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files -- library
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery
 .
 The Eclipse file format is widely used in the reservoir simulation
 community. This package provides library containing code for processing
 files in Eclipse format as well as utility code used by other OPM
 modules.

Description: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files -- utility programs
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery
 .
 The Eclipse file format is widely used in the reservoir simulation
 community. This package provides utility programs to process files
 in this format, like for comparing two files, converting between
 binary version and formatted text file format, etc.

Description: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files -- development files
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery
 .
 This package contains the shared buildsystem of all OPM modules,
 the headers for input, parsing, and output of files in Eclipse format,
 a format widely used in the reservoir simulation community, and generic
 utilities used in other OPM modules.

Description: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files -- documentation
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery
 .
 This package contains the source code documentation of library and tools
 for Eclipse reservoir simulation files.

Description: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files -- python wrappers.
 The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
 tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes, especially
 for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced oil recovery
 .
 This package contains the python wrappers for reading, parsing, and writing
 files in Eclipse format, a format widely used in the reservoir simulation
 community.
